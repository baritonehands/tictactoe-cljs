# Tic Tac Toe in Clojurescript + React

The `shadow-cljs` is a build tool for ClojureScript.

The `proto-repl` is a Clojure(Script) dev env for [Atom](https://atom.io/)

The `reagent` is a ClojureScript wrapper for [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Install
``` shell
npm install -g shadow-cljs

# or with yarn

yarn global add shadow-cljs
```

## Run

``` shell
yarn install

yarn dev
```

## Generate CSS

This is done automatically by ```yarn dev``` and ```yarn release```, but it can be
run separately.

```shell
yarn css
```

## Clean

``` shell
yarn clean
```

## Release

``` shell
yarn release
```
